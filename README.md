##Data Science Project - EDA 
#Project Overview
This project involves data analysis and predictive modeling using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The objective is to explore and preprocess the data, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and develop machine learning models to make data-driven predictions.

#Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights on data distribution, trends, and relationships.
Modeling: Implementation of machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes and evaluate model performance.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
Usage
#Clone the repository.
Open ProjectPDS.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell sequentially to follow the analysis and model training steps.
#Results
This notebook provides insights into data patterns and evaluates model performance metrics to determine the best approach for predictive analysis.

#License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
