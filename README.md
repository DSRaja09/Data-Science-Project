# Data-Science-Project
This is my Data Science project for a PDS course! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating essential data science workflows, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling in Python. This project is a helpful resource for anyone interested in hands-on data science. 

# Overview:
This project demonstrates the entire data science process:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, etc.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data and discovering patterns.
Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting features to enhance model performance.
Model Training and Tuning: Training models and optimizing hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model accuracy and other relevant metrics.

# Results and Visualizations
The notebook includes visualizations and key results for model evaluation and data insights, such as:

Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
Data visualizations to explore trends and relationships
Model comparisons for various algorithms
